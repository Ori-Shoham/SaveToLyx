Description: Create and manage a specific format of tex files for using
    values calculated in R within your latex document. Each file conatins 
    values and the names of the commands associated with them. Using these
    files as inputs in your latex document allows you to use the values saved
    in them by calling the command associated with them instead of copy-pasting
    for your R session.
