# savetexvalue

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`savetexvalue` helps saving and managing values calculated in R for integration in
projects written in LaTeX in an automatic and reproducible way. savetexvalue
uses special formatted `.tex` files containing pairs of values and command
names to be used in LaTeX.


## Installation

You can install the development version of savetexvalue from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Ori-Shoham/savetexvalue")
```

## Usage and examples

Suppose you work on a project analyzing the sepal length of irises. 
```{r example}
library(savetexvalue)
library(dplyr)
data(iris)

# These are the computations
avg_sep_length <- iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarise(sep_length_avg = mean(Sepal.Length))

prop_greater_6 <- iris %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarise(prop_greater = mean(Sepal.Length>6))

# Save the values:
path <- tempdir()
save_tex_value(values = avg_sep_length$sep_length_avg,
               names = paste0(avg_sep_length$Species,"Avg"),
               file_name = "iris_calc",
               path = path)
save_tex_value(values = prop_greater_6$prop_greater,
               names = paste0(prop_greater_6$Species,"PerGreaterSix"),
               file_name = "iris_calc",
               path = path,
               percent = T,
               accuracy = 0.1)
```

The contents of `iris_calc.tex` should now be:

```{}
\newcommand\setosaAvg {5.01}
\newcommand\setosaPerGreaterSix {0.0\%}
\newcommand\versicolorAvg {5.94}
\newcommand\versicolorPerGreaterSix {40.0\%}
\newcommand\virginicaAvg {6.59}
\newcommand\virginicaPerGreaterSix {82.0\%}
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.


```{r, include = FALSE}
unlink("iris.tex")
```
